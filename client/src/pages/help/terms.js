          Microsoft collects data from you, through our interactions with you
          and through our products. You provide some of this data directly, and
          we get some of it by collecting data about your interactions, use, and
          experiences with our products. The data we collect depends on the
          context of your interactions with Microsoft and the choices you make,
          including your privacy settings and the products and features you use.
          We also obtain data about you from third parties. If you represent an
          organization, such as a business or school, that utilizes Enterprise
          and Developer Products from Microsoft, please see the Enterprise and
          developer products section of this privacy statement to learn how we
          process your data. If you are an end user of a Microsoft product or a
          Microsoft account provided by your organization, please see the
          Products provided by your organization and the Microsoft account
          sections for more information. You have choices when it comes to the
          technology you use and the data you share. When we ask you to provide
          personal data, you can decline. Many of our products require some
          personal data to provide you with a service. If you choose not to
          provide data required to provide you with a product or feature, you
          cannot use that product or feature. Likewise, where we need to collect
          personal data by law or to enter into or carry out a contract with
          you, and you do not provide the data, we will not be able to enter
          into the contract; or if this relates to an existing product you’re
          using, we may have to suspend or cancel it. We will notify you if this
          is the case at the time. Where providing the data is optional, and you
          choose not to share personal data, features like personalization that
          use such data will not work for you. Learn more

            How we use personal data
          </span>
          <br />
          <br />
          Microsoft uses the data we collect to provide you with rich,
          interactive experiences. In particular, we use data to: Provide our
          products, which includes updating, securing, and troubleshooting, as
          well as providing support. It also includes sharing data, when it is
          required to provide the service or carry out the transactions you
          request. Improve and develop our products. Personalize our products
          and make recommendations. Advertise and market to you, which includes
          sending promotional communications, targeting advertising, and
          presenting you with relevant offers. We also use the data to operate
          our business, which includes analyzing our performance, meeting our
          legal obligations, developing our workforce, and doing research. In
          carrying out these purposes, we combine data we collect from different
          contexts (for example, from your use of two Microsoft products) or
          obtain from third parties to give you a more seamless, consistent, and
          personalized experience, to make informed business decisions, and for
          other legitimate purposes. Our processing of personal data for these
          purposes includes both automated and manual (human) methods of
          processing. Our automated methods often are related to and supported
          by our manual methods. For example, our automated methods include
          artificial intelligence (AI), which we think of as a set of
          technologies that enable computers to perceive, learn, reason, and
          assist in decision-making to solve problems in ways that are similar
          to what people do. To build, train, and improve the accuracy of our
          automated methods of processing (including AI), we manually review
          some of the predictions and inferences produced by the automated
          methods against the underlying data from which the predictions and
          inferences were made. For example, we manually review short snippets
          of voice data that we have taken steps to de-identify to improve our
          speech recognition technologies. This manual review may be conducted
          by Microsoft employees or vendors who are working on Microsoft’s
          behalf.
